# Website

This is my personal website. I made this mostly as a learning experience with html, css and web hosting on linux.

## How to run
1) Make sure you have python and flask installed. 
2) Downoad the project. 
3) Run the python file (with linux, prefix with "sudo " in the console). 
4) Go to "localhost" in a web browser.
5) Enjoy!
